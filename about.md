I am an undergraduate marine biology major at The University of Rhode Island and a member of the Putnam Laboratory. My research interests involve coral biomineralization and calcification, ocean acidification, and coral physiology. I am specifically interested in the affects of anthropogenic climate change on coral biomineralization and their progeny.
