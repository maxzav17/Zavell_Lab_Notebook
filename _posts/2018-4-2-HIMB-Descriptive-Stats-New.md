* Descriptive statistics for HOBO loggers at sites 1-4
* Descriptive statistics and quality control of data was completed in R
* Data has 2 decimals because the HOBO data logger has a data resolution of .00
* Data is from 2/17/2016 – 4/27/2016 and 6/14/2016 – 6/19/2016 because this is the only complete set of data that overlaps for every site
