# <center> Graphs of the HIMB HOBO Data Set Using R

## Goals:
* To see where there are gaps in the data set.

## Graphs:

**Fig 1.** Scatterplot of the average temperature data from HIMB at four sites. Error Bars were made using
standard error (SE).

**Fig 2.** Scatterplot with lines of the average temperature data from HIMB at four sites. Error Bars were
made using standard error (SE). Lines in between the points do not represent data.

## Conclusions and Future Work:
* To see the major gaps in the data, all the data should be graphed without averaging it by day.
Averaging the data by day can misinterpret the data because some days have more or less data points
which can skew the averages. Overall these graphs show the general trends of the data set and
highlights the areas where there is no data (by day not hour). The next task is to plot all the data points
together, to get a greater understanding and view of the gaps in the data set.
